Using Walt to create Mandelbrot sets in WebAssembly

A simple Mandelbrot Set generator written in [Walt](https://github.com/ballercat/walt) and compiled to WebAssembly. It generates a Mandelbrot at full window resolution repeatedly for 10 seconds and then stops.

The code for this example can be executed here: <http://www.storiesinflight.com/walt/mandelbrot-1/walt-mandelbrot-demo/index.html>
